#### Rules of the game:
* Player X always goes first
* Players alternate positions on the board
* Players cannot play on already taken places, ie on already played positions
* A player with three X's or O's in a row, whether diagonal, horizontal or vertical, wins the game
* If all nine squares have been filled and neither player has achieved three in a row, the game ends in a draw

#### How to run this [TODO - add instructions below]:
* You would need Docker installed
